PROJECT DESCRIPTION : 
This project involves developing a command-line chatbot using Python and the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) library.
The chatbot is designed to respond to user queries with relevant news headlines based on a predefined dataset. 
It leverages basic natural language processing techniques such as tokenization, lemmatization, and stop word removal 
to interpret user input and compare it to a list of recent news headlines. When a user enters a question, the chatbot processes 
the input and identifies the most relevant headline by measuring keyword overlap with each news item. The chatbot supports casual, 
natural-language queries about topics like sports, health, politics, and technology, and responds with the closest matching headline. 
If no meaningful match is found, it gracefully informs the user. The system is interactive and runs in the terminal, with an option 
to exit by typing "exit." This project showcases how simple NLP techniques can be applied to build a context-aware, keyword-driven chatbot.
